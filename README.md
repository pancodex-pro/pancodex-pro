# Welcome to Pancodex

Pancodex is a platform for managing and publishing content on websites. Our goal is to make it easy for content creators and developers to create and manage a professional and effective website.

With Pancodex, you can focus on creating and managing your website's content while we take care of the technical details. We offer a ready-made website code created with the popular JavaScript framework NextJS, and you can customize the website's appearance using the Tailwind CSS framework. Your website's source code is stored in a GitHub repository, which means you fully own the code and data of your website. You can host your website on any hosting platform using this repository.

Our platform has an intuitive user interface for creating and editing content that takes into account content creation trends in all popular content publishing systems. It's easy to add and edit text, images, and other media, and you can customize your website's appearance too. Pancodex also helps you manage content in different languages, which is great if you want to reach a global audience. When you create content, Pancodex takes care of the technical points necessary for optimizing your website for search engines.

Pancodex lets you preview different themes and easily switch between them to find the right one for your website. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to your website with just a few clicks, and Pancodex will handle the details of updating the website files and pushing the changes to the GitHub repository.

For developers, Pancodex also offers the ability to quickly create and modify website themes using Tailwind. You can download a Tailwind SDK from the CMS service for each theme separately. This SDK includes the source code for the website theme, as well as a local server that connects the theme to the website preview in your browser. By modifying the source code, you can easily change the appearance of the website theme in real-time and see the changes reflected in the preview. This offers a convenient and flexible way to create and customize website themes using Tailwind. Pancodex handles the details of integrating the modified theme with the website files and pushing the changes to the repository on GitHub, allowing you to focus on the design and appearance of your website.
